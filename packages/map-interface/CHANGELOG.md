## [1.3.1] - 2025-06-25

Small improvements to types and styles

## [1.3.0] - 2025-04-09

- Improve types for latitude and longitude
- Add `useBasicMapStyle` hook and supporting `getBasicMapStyle` function
- Improve initialization logic to avoid rendering before the map is ready. We
  fall back to timeouts because Mapbox GL events aren't called consistently
- Add a `standalone` option for map rendering
- Add internal support for `overlayStyles`, which are added after the basic map
  style is loaded, and `transformStyle`, which can adjust the style after load

## [1.2.4] - 2025-03-08

Fix some small styling errors

## [1.2.3] - 2025-02-23

- Allow map interface to be rendered without a context panel
- Create a story for streamlining style reloading with 3D terrain
- Move all terrain management to `@macrostrat/mapbox-react`
- New approach to setting up map styles that reduces the chance of full
  re-renders of terrain layers. This enables smoother transitions between
  minimally varying map styles.
